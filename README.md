***--------------------NOTE------------------------------***

Local Host Will Work fine but when you open this (On Your Network : https://192.......) some features specially copy text will not work as it required HTTPS support for Website so for that either you find out yourself or use OpenSSL Method like me.

1. Install OpenSSL.
2. Generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL.
3. Configure your React project to use HTTPS with the generated certificate by updating the .env file.
4. Start your development server, and your site will be served over HTTPS.

kindly use chatgpt for further help if its too complex for you to understand heeee...
